# Operating_system_and_browser_identification_in_TLS_traffic

## Project Aim
The main objective of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying the operating system (OS) and web browser utilized by clients in TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypted network traffic. By analyzing the specific patterns and characteristics of TLS handshakes and other related features, the model aims to distinguish between different OS and browser combinations, even in the presence of encrypted communications.

## Importance
As cybersecurity concerns continue to grow, it is increasingly important to have effective methods for identifying potential threats and understanding user behavior in network traffic. Identifying the OS and browser used by clients can provide valuable insights for network administrators, security professionals, and developers, allowing them to:

Enhance security measures by detecting unusual or suspicious activity.
Optimize websites and applications for specific browser and OS combinations.
Gain a better understanding of user demographics and preferences.
Moreover, achieving this identification while preserving the privacy and integrity of encrypted communications (e.g., TLS) ensures that the security and confidentiality of the data remain uncompromised.

## Dataset Source
The dataset utilized for this project was generated in a controlled Venari virtual environment. The data was obtained by capturing TLS traffic generated by visiting a predefined list of websites using various web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Edge. The traffic was generated on machines running different operating systems from diverse families (Windows, Linux, macOS) and versions (e.g., Windows 10, Windows 11). This comprehensive dataset enables the development of a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying a wide range of OS and browser combinations in real-world scenarios.
